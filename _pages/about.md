======
I am a graduate student in pattern recognition and intelligent system at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/main.htm). Since 2018, I have been co-advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oAUB9cQAAAAJ&hl=en">Zhuliang Yu</a> and [Wei Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=HKmFkdwAAAAJ) at the Center for Brain-Computer Interfaces and Information Processing (leader: [Yuqing Li](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=wN3v1coAAAAJ&hl=en)). I am broadly intereted in developing new methods to incorporate prior knoledge into neural network with a probablistic perspective. In particular, I am passionate about deep generative models (DGMs), Bayesian Deep learning, and their applications to brain signals. 
> A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a system that extracts and translates the brain activity patterns of a subject into messages or commands for an interactive application. Brain signal is a continuous temporal signal with a low signal-to-noise ratio and multi-channels, including but not limited to EEG, MEG, and fMRI. They are widely utilized in various applications such as brain signal classification, brain source localization, and multi-modal signal reconstruction. Deep learning has lifted the performance of BCI systems significantly in recent years. However, the problems like the limited BCI data, the high dimensionality of data structure, the poor quality of acquisited data, and the significant divergences between individual subject's signals are still challenging the development of deep learning models in BCI tasks. To achieve a better performance, incorporating the prior knowledge into neural networks is the key point, e.g., the specific designed NN architectures, the hybrid NN modeling with 'traditional' machine learning approches, or the techniques like regularization or data augmentation.

Recent research works I focused on:

* brain source localization with deep learning models and prior modeling[[1]]()
* EEG-fMRI mutual learning with deep generative models and Bayesian inference <a href="">[2]</a>
* EEG decoding and classification with hybrid models [[3]]().

I worked at Xiamen airline Co. China as an engineer during Aug 2016 to Oct 2017. I obtained my undergrad degree in automation from Civil Aviation University of China (Tianjin, China) in 2016.
