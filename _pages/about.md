======
I am a graduate student in pattern recognition and intelligent system at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/main.htm). Since 2018, I have been co-advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oAUB9cQAAAAJ&hl=en">Zhuliang Yu</a> and [Wei Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=HKmFkdwAAAAJ) at the Center for Brain-Computer Interfaces and Information Processing (director: [Yuanqing Li](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=wN3v1coAAAAJ&hl=en)). I am broadly interested in developing new methods to incorporate prior knowledge into neural network with a probabilistic perspective. In particular, I am passionate about deep generative models (DGMs), Bayesian Deep learning, and their applications to brain signals. 

> A Brain-Computer Interface is a system that extracts and translates the brain activity patterns of a subject into messages or commands for an interactive application. Extracted brain signals are multichannel continuous-time signals with a low signal-to-noise ratio, including but not limited to Electro/Magnetoencephalography (E/MEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). They are widely utilized in various BCI applications such as task classification, the brain source localization (electromagnetic source imaging), and multimodal reconstruction. While deep learning has brought a revolution for BCI systems in recent years, the problems in the BCI area, such as limited and corrupted training sets, the high dimensionality of data structure, and significant divergences across trial subjectâ€™s signals, are still challenging the application of deep learning models. Thus, incorporating expert knowledge into neural networks (NNs), especially via the Bayesian paradigm, is becoming an attractive solution in BCI tasks.

Recent research works I focused on:

* Brain source localization with priors modeling and deep learning approaches[[1]]()
* EEG-fMRI multimodal learning with deep generative models and Bayesian inference <a href="">[2]</a>
* EEG decoding and classification with hybrid models [[3]]().

I worked at Xiamen airline Co. China as an engineer during Aug 2016 to Oct 2017. I obtained my undergrad degree in automation from Civil Aviation University of China (Tianjin, China) in 2016.
