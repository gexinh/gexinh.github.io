About  [<font size=3>[Code]</font>](https://github.com/gexinh) [<font size=3>[CV]</font>](files/cv_gexin.pdf) [<font size=3>[Transcripts]</font>](files/transcripts.pdf)  
======
Currently, I am a PhD student supervised by [Xiaoxiao Li](https://tea.ece.ubc.ca/) at [the Trusted and Efficient AI (TEA) lab](https://tea.ece.ubc.ca/), [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). 
During 2022-2023, I was a research assistant supervisored by [Xiaodan Liang](https://lemondan.github.io/) at the Human Cyber Physical Intelligence Integration ([HCP](https://www.sysu-hcp.net/)) Lab, [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/index.htm) (Guangzhou, China). 
Before that, I received master's Degree in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/main.htm) (Guangzhou, China). 
Since 2018, I have been co-advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oAUB9cQAAAAJ&hl=en">Zhuliang Yu</a> and [Wei Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=HKmFkdwAAAAJ) at the Center for Brain-Computer Interfaces and Information Processing (director: [Yuanqing Li](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=wN3v1coAAAAJ&hl=en)).

My general research interests lie in Bayesian learning and machine learning techniques for interdisciplinary tasks. In particular, I am passionate about the intersection of deep learning and Bayesian statistics, geerative model, explainability, and graph representation learning.

<!-- 
> A Brain-Computer Interface is a system that extracts and translates the brain activity patterns of a subject into messages or commands for an interactive application. Extracted brain signals are multichannel continuous-time signals with a low signal-to-noise ratio, including but not limited to Electro/Magnetoencephalography (E/MEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). They are widely utilized in various BCI applications such as task classification, the brain source localization (electromagnetic source imaging), and multimodal reconstruction. While deep learning has brought a revolution for BCI systems in recent years, the problems in the BCI area, such as limited and corrupted training sets, the high dimensionality of data structure, and significant divergences across trial subject’s signals, are still challenging the application of deep learning models. Thus, incorporating expert knowledge into neural networks (NNs), especially via the Bayesian paradigm, is becoming an attractive solution in BCI tasks. -->

Recent research works I focused on:
* 2D&3D Brain Modelling via Diffusion Model [[1]]()
* Self-supervised learning and graph representation learning for whole slide images (WSIs) [[2]]()
* Ill-posed inverse problem for brain source localization via a deep learning paradigm[[3]]()
* EEG-fMRI multimodal learning with deep generative models and Bayesian inference <a href="">[4]</a>
* EEG decoding and classification with hybrid models [[5]]().
