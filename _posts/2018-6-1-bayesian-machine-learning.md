This is a learning note about Bayesian Machine Learning. Their bedrock is Probabilistic Graphic Model (PGMs) and Bayesian Inference.

# Road Map 
  * Posterior is feasible
    * Maximum a posteriori estimation
    * Expectation Maximization (EM) approximation
  * Posterior is intractable
    * Sampling methods: 
      * Importanced sampling
      * Reject sampling
      * Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling
    * Approximation inference:
      * Variational inference
        * Mean-field 
      * Expectation propagation
